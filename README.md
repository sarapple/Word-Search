# Word-Search
##Used linked nodes for each letter and then going through and finding the words. Extensive use of  jQuery on this Node.JS Express web app game.  

##I created a word search game given a random assortment of letters in a txt file, extracted the data and set their coordinates. Then found the words from a word list that were hidden in the letters. Finally, created the view with the answers available.
